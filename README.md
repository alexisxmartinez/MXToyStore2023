# Power BI Analysis Project: Retail Toy Stores in Mexico - 2023
üìö This project aims to analyze a dataset containing information about stores, products, and sales transactions in Mexico. The dataset source comes from Maven Analytics and can be found [here](https://www.mavenanalytics.io/data-playground).

## Data Dictionary
The dataset is structured using the following data dictionary:
- üè¢ Store_ID =	Store ID
- üè™ Store_Name = Store name
- üåÜ Store_City =	City in Mexico where the store is located
- üó∫Ô∏è Store_Location =	Location in the city where the store is located
- üìÖ Store_Open_Date =	Date when the store was opened
- üì¶ Product_ID =	Product ID
- üìù Product_Name =	Product name
- üè∑Ô∏è Product_Category =	Product Category
- üí≤ Product_Cost =	Product cost ($USD)
- üí≤ Product_Price =	Product retail price ($USD)
- üíº Sale_ID =	Sale ID
- üìÖ Date =	Date of the transaction
- üî¢ Units =	Units sold
- üìä Stock_On_Hand =	Stock quantity of the product in the store (inventory)

## üîç The main objectives of this project are:

- Perform comprehensive data analysis to gain insights into the stores, products, and sales transactions.
- Identify patterns, trends, and relationships within the dataset.
- Conduct statistical analysis to uncover key metrics and performance indicators.
- Build predictive models to forecast sales and optimize inventory management.
- Develop interactive and visually appealing dashboards to present findings and insights.

# Project Breakdown

## Throughout this project, you can expect to:

- Explore the dataset using Power Query to understand its structure and contents.
- Clean and preprocess the data to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
- Perform exploratory data analysis using various statistical and visual techniques.
- Develop calculated columns and measures to derive meaningful insights.
- Create interactive dashboards using Power BI to present key findings and visualizations.

## Data Acquisition & Cleansing 
- Given the nature of this project, I didn't go for any fancy extraction method other than importing the CSV files directly. If I could it again, I'd be probably connect to my local MYSQL server and just extract the data from there. 
- The data required little to no cleaning up or normalization, the only modifications I did was removing "Maven Toys" from the store names, and updating "Ciudad de Mexico" to "Mexico City" in order for the maps visualization to function properly.
- I used Power Query's option to view data distribution and column statistics to do some exploratory analysis. 

## Modeling & Calculations 
- To build the schema we used the primary & foreign keys within each dimension table and connected them to the sales fact table, this was pretty simple and easily done through Power BI's relationship editor. 
- I decided to aggregate a date table using DAX , here's the DAX code I used: 

```TimeTable = 
VAR MinDate = MIN('Sales'[Date])
VAR MaxDate = MAX('Sales'[Date])
RETURN
    ADDCOLUMNS(
        CALENDAR(MinDate, MaxDate),
        "Year", YEAR([Date]),
        "Month", FORMAT([Date], "MMM"),
        "Quarter", "Q" & FORMAT([Date], "Q")
    )
```
- For a better time series analysis, I added the Month/Year group, this allows for an accurate chronological order and facilitates visualizations. 
- We converted the Data Category for Store_City, this allowed the map visualizations to function accurately.
These are several Measures I found to be very useful:
- Target Sales: We needed to establish a target for our total monthly revenue, that way we could create a KPI card to measure our performance on a monthly basis.

```
Target Sales = 24000000
```
- Total Cost: This allows us to calculate how much each product is costing us, then summarizes it. It can be used a granular level. 


```
Total Cost = SUMX(Sales, Sales[Units] * RELATED(Products[Product_Cost])) 
```
- Total Margin: With this measure we calculate the total % of margin.


```
Total Margin = [Total Sales] - [Total Cost]
```
- Total Profit: With this measure we calculate the total profit brought in.


```
Total Profit = SUMX(Sales, (Sales[Units] * RELATED(Products[Product_Price])) - (Sales[Units] * RELATED(Products[Product_Cost])))
 ```
- Total Sales: With this measure we calculate the total sales brought in.


 ```
 Total Sales = SUM('Sales'[Units]) * SUM(products[Product_Price])
 ```
- Margin (by product): With this measure we calculate the % of margin per product.


```
Margin = DIVIDE(Products[Product_Price] - Products[Product_Cost], Products[Product_Price])
```
- Profit (by product): With this measure we calculate the profit per product.


```
Profit by Toy = Products[Product_Price] - Products[Product_Cost]
```
- Stock levels: With this measure we calculate the total inventory. 

```
Stock Levels = SUM(inventory[Stock_On_Hand])
```
## Reports & Dashboard 

### Sales Overview
Objective: Provide an overview of sales performance and trends.
Visualizations:
- Report cards for Total Sales, Total Profit & Stock levels.
